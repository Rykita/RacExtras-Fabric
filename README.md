# RacExtras Fabric Version

This is the main and official repository for the RacExtras mod.

Content from the Quark mod by Vazkii has been taken and adapted for my purposes as TEMPORARY CONTENT.

Quark's ideas and content are also from Vazkii, assets for these ideas will be replaced with original ones once I can receive proper texture help.

Content from New Default+ by SeaOfPixels and Jaden's Nether Expansion by JadenXgamer has been taken for purposes of this mod.


hic sunt dracones, Here be dragons!

The code in this mod is highly experimental and done by a zook. Feel free to PR or suggest changes to the mod. Don't expect it to be cleanly written,
and most importantly, be respectful. If my code sucks, make a issue, PR or DM me on Discord at Fakerac#8754, I don't want to be barraged with snarky comments.
